Sample DR Test Scenarios for Financial RAG Systems

Scenario 1: Hard Drive Failure - Primary Region
Timeline: 09:35 AM - Hard drive fails in US-EAST-1 RDS instance
Expected RTO: 8 minutes
Expected Data Loss: 2 minutes of documents
Failover Target: US-WEST-2 DR region

Scenario 2: Quarterly DR Test Execution
Test Date: 2024-12-15 14:00 UTC
Pre-Test: 10,432 documents in primary
Post-Test: 10,428 documents in DR (4 documents in-flight)
Measured RTO: 8 minutes (Target: 15 minutes) - PASS
Measured RPO: 5 minutes (Target: 60 minutes) - PASS

Scenario 3: Document Ingestion During Replication
Batch Size: 500 earnings reports for financial institutions
Total Size: 250 MB
Processing Time: 8 minutes
Replication Lag During Ingestion: 2-3 minutes
Final Sync Time: 10 minutes

Sample Financial Queries:
- What were earnings trends for Apple Inc in 2023?
- Provide analysis of Bank of America Q3 2024 earnings report
- What is the current P/E ratio for technology sector companies?
- Show me risk factors disclosed in Tesla's latest 10-K filing
- Compare revenue growth rates for major financial institutions

RTO/RPO Requirements:
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 15 minutes maximum
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour maximum data loss
Typical Performance: 8-12 minute RTO, 5-10 minute RPO

Compliance Requirements:
FINRA Rule 4370: Quarterly DR testing required
SOX Section 404: 7-year document retention
GLBA: Encryption at rest and in transit
SEC: Complete audit trail for trading decisions

Infrastructure Components:
Primary Region: US-EAST-1 (Pinecone, RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ, EC2 AutoScaling)
DR Region: US-WEST-2 (Pinecone Replica, RDS Read Replica, EC2 AutoScaling)
DNS Failover: Route 53 with 60-second TTL
Monitoring: CloudWatch, PagerDuty integration
Backup: S3 + Glacier for 7-year retention

Cost Structure:
Monthly DR Infrastructure: ₹2.5L (~$3,000 USD)
Cost per Hour of Downtime: ₹30K (~$360 USD) in direct losses
Break-even: Hot DR pays for itself if prevents ONE major outage every 4 years
Estimated ROI: Positive given typical hardware failure rates (1-2 incidents per decade)
