    "# L3 M9.2: Financial Compliance Risk - Risk Assessment in Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Arc\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Build production-ready risk assessment and compliance guardrails for financial RAG systems to prevent unauthorized investment advice and ensure regulatory compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "- Query risk classification using pattern matching and semantic analysis\n",
    "- Multi-factor confidence scoring (retrieval quality, source diversity, temporal consistency, citation agreement)\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance guardrails (RIA, MNPI, Safe Harbor, Form 8-K)\n",
    "- Human-in-the-loop escalation workflows for high-risk queries\n",
    "- User context adjustment for account type and query history\n",
    "- Adversarial query handling and edge case management\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Completing This Notebook:**\n",
    "- You will understand the legal distinction between financial information and investment advice\n",
    "- You can implement hybrid risk classification (pattern + semantic)\n",
    "- You will recognize when queries require RIA escalation\n",
    "- You can build multi-factor confidence scoring systems\n",
    "- You will understand SEC regulations (RIA Act 1940, Reg FD, Safe Harbor, 8-K)\n",
    "- You can design compliance audit trails for financial RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context in Track L3.M9:**\n",
    "This module builds on L3 M7 (Financial Document Types) and L3 M8 (Metadata Structures) and prepares you for L3 M10 (Multi-Document Synthesis with Citation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "**February 2023:** A well-funded fintech startup with a beautiful AI-powered investment platform got hit with a **$12 million SEC fine**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue? Their RAG system crossed from providing information into providing investment advice without RIA (Registered Investment Advisor) licensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Legal Distinction:**\n",
    "- âœ… **Legal (Information):** \"Tesla's P/E ratio is 65\"\n",
    "- ❌ **Investment Advice (requires RIA):** \"Tesla's P/E is high, consider waiting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC enforcement is **behavior-based**, not intent-based. Disclaimers don't protect you if your system behaves like an advisor."

    "**What You've Built:**\n",
    "- âœ" Hybrid risk classifier (pattern + semantic)\n",
    "- âœ" Multi-factor confidence scorer (5 components)\n",
    "- âœ" Four regulatory compliance guardrails\n",
    "- âœ" User context adjustment logic\n",
    "- âœ" Human-in-the-loop escalation workflow\n",
    "- âœ" Audit logging for compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "1. **Pattern matching (60%) prioritizes legal safety** over nuanced understanding\n",
    "2. **Confidence <0.50 = refuse to answer** to prevent hallucination liability\n",
    "3. **HIGH risk queries MUST escalate** to licensed advisors (no exceptions)\n",
    "4. **MNPI violations = insider trading risk** â†' block documents predating disclosure\n",
    "5. **Audit everything** for SEC compliance (SOX Section 404)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regulatory Reminders:**\n",
    "- Information: \"Tesla's P/E is 65\" âœ… Legal\n",
    "- Advice: \"Tesla's P/E is high, wait\" ❌ Requires RIA\n",
    "- Disclaimers don't protect if system *behaves* like an advisor\n",
    "- SEC enforcement is behavior-based, not intent-based\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Deploy to production with audit logging\n",
    "- Set up human escalation workflow\n",
    "- Monitor false positive/negative rates\n",
    "- Review patterns quarterly with legal team\n",
