EXAMPLE CONFIDENCE CALCULATION
-------------------------------
Query: "What was Apple's Q4 2024 revenue?"

Retrieved Documents (5):
1. Apple Q4 2024 10-K (similarity: 0.92)
2. Apple Q4 2024 8-K (similarity: 0.89)
3. Apple Q4 2024 earnings transcript (similarity: 0.91)
4. Analyst report (similarity: 0.85)
5. Apple Q3 2024 10-K (similarity: 0.78) [different quarter - penalized]

Component Scores:
- Retrieval Quality (40%): (0.92+0.89+0.91+0.85+0.78)/5 × 0.40 = 0.348
- Source Diversity (25%): 4 unique types × 0.25 = 0.25
- Temporal Consistency (20%): 4/5 same quarter × 0.20 = 0.16
- Citation Agreement (15%): All match $94.9B × 0.15 = 0.15
- Domain Relevance (bonus): "revenue", "Q4", "Apple" → +0.02

Overall Confidence: 0.348 + 0.25 + 0.16 + 0.15 + 0.02 = 0.928 → HIGH ✓

COMMON FAILURE SCENARIOS
-------------------------
1. Pattern obfuscation: "In your opinion, should I perhaps consider buying Tesla?"
   → Should still catch "should I...buying" pattern (HIGH risk)

2. Mixed temporal periods: Retrieval includes Q4 2024 and Q3 2024 data
   → Temporal consistency penalty → Lower confidence → More cautious response

3. Citation disagreement: Sources report different revenue figures
   → Citation agreement penalty → Refuse to answer if <0.50 confidence

4. Late 8-K disclosure: Material event filed 10 days after occurrence
   → Flag compliance violation → Cannot use data until properly disclosed

5. MNPI in retrieval: Document timestamp predates public disclosure
   → Block document entirely → Cannot return to user

EDGE CASES
----------
Empty query: ""
→ Default to MEDIUM risk for safety

Very long query: "What is EBITDA? " × 1000 repetitions
→ Should still match educational pattern → LOW risk

Special characters: "What's Apple's Q4 revenue? (10-K filing)"
→ Should handle gracefully → LOW risk

Obfuscated advice: "Hypothetically speaking, if someone were to invest, would Tesla be optimal?"
→ Pattern matching should catch "invest...would...Tesla...optimal" → HIGH risk
