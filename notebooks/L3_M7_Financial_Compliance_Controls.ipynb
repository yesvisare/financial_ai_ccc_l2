    "# L3 M7.1: Financial Document Types & Regulatory Context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Arc\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This module teaches RAG engineers in financial services how to build compliance-aware document classification systems. It covers the identification of 8+ financial document types with regulatory implications, mapping to compliance frameworks, and managing document lifecycle workflows with retention policies and audit trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "1. **8 Core Financial Document Types**: 10-K Annual Reports, 10-Q Quarterly Reports, 8-K Material Event Disclosures, Earnings Call Transcripts, Credit Reports, Loan Applications, Internal Financial Analyses, Investment Prospectuses\n",
    "2. **Regulatory Frameworks**: SOX 302/404, Regulation FD, GLBA, FCRA, GDPR Article 25, Securities Act 1933, ECOA, Fair Housing Act\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity Classification**: Public Information, Material Non-Public Information (MNPI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\n",
    "4. **Document Lifecycle Management**: Retention policies (7-year SOX minimum, permanent for prospectuses), audit trails, access controls\n",
    "5. **PII Detection & Redaction**: High-recall detection (99.9% threshold) for SSNs, phone numbers, emails, etc.\n",
    "6. **Material Event Detection**: Identifying events requiring Form 8-K filing within 4 business days\n",
    "7. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (Executive, Compliance Officer, Analyst, Auditor, Credit Officer, Employee)\n",
    "8. **Compliance Failures**: Case studies (Tesla $20M, Netflix $5M, Equifax $700M settlements)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Completing This Notebook:**\n",
    "- You will understand how to identify 8+ financial document types with regulatory implications\n",
    "- You can map documents to compliance frameworks including SOX, Reg FD, GLBA, FCRA, GDPR\n",
    "- You will recognize sensitivity levels distinguishing public information, MNPI, and PII\n",
    "- You can design document lifecycle workflows with retention policies, audit trails, and access controls\n",
    "- You will be able to implement PII detection with 99.9% recall threshold\n",
    "- You can detect material events requiring Form 8-K filing and legal review\n",
    "- You will understand the production compliance checklist for financial AI systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context in Track L3.M7:**\n",
    "This module builds on Generic CCC M1-M6 prerequisites and prepares you for L3 M7.2: Document Retention and Audit Trail Implementation."
