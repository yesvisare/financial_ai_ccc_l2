Example of Conflicting Sources:

Source 1 (10-Q): "Revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $81.8B"
Source 2 (Earnings Call): "Revenue was essentially flat year-over-year at $82.0B on a constant currency basis"
Source 3 (Analyst Report): "Revenue grew 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divested businesses"

Proper Response: "Revenue shows mixed signals: 10-Q reports 5% decline [1], earnings call describes results as flat on constant currency basis [2], while analysts calculate 2% growth when adjusted for divestitures [3]. Discrepancies stem from different accounting adjustments."
