        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Financial PII encompasses 12+ types** (SSN, routing, account, tax ID, credit card, etc.), each requiring different detection strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Presidio provides 95%+ recall out-of-box, 99.9%+ with custom recognizers**, balancing accuracy and cost better than regex-only (70-80%) or cloud APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Audit trails are non-negotiable** for financial compliance (SOX Section 404: 7-year retention with hash-verified integrity)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Custom recognizers** (routing number with ABA checksum, account with heuristics, tax ID with EIN format) address financial-specific PII missing from generic detection\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Production architecture** requires chunking (large documents), caching (reduce re-processing), monitoring (alert on anomalies)\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We Built\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **FinancialPIIRedactor** with 99.9%+ recall on financial PII\n",
        "✅ **Custom recognizers** for Tax ID, Routing Number, Account Number\n",
        "✅ **Immutable audit trail** with SHA-256 hashing and entity breakdown\n",
        "✅ **Batch processing pipeline** for 10,000+ docs/day\n",
        "✅ **Performance validation** (200-500ms latency)\n",
