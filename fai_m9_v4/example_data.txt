SUPPORTING EVIDENCE EXAMPLES
-----------------------------
REJECTED: Q3 earnings beat driven by $200M one-time tax benefit. Excluding one-time gain, Tesla missed estimates by $0.04. Proposed $20M position breaches 5% concentration limit. Recommend modified $4M increase to $16M (4% concentration).

APPROVED: Loan applicant demonstrates strong credit history (780 FICO), debt-to-income ratio of 28%, and 5-year business track record. Collateral valuation at 140% of loan amount. Approve $2.5M at prime + 1.5%.

MODIFIED: Original rebalancing proposal too aggressive given current market volatility (VIX at 28). Recommend phased approach: reduce energy exposure by 2.5% per quarter over 2 quarters instead of immediate 5% reduction.

ESCALATED: M&A due diligence incomplete - missing environmental liability assessment and pension obligation analysis. Potential undisclosed liabilities could exceed $3M. Escalate to Board Audit Committee for further review.
